The game uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and is divided into multiple classes:

Snake â€“ handles snake creation and movement

Food â€“ randomly spawns food items

Scoreboard â€“ keeps and displays the score

ðŸŽ® Features:

Smooth snake movement

Randomly generated food

Real-time score tracking

Game-over detection

Simple arrow-key controls

ðŸ§  Concepts Used:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Event-driven programming

Collision detection
